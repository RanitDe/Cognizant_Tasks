## Exercise 2: Using Stream API for Processing Collections

## Objectives:
•	Use Stream API to process collections.
•	Perform various operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing on streams.

## Business Scenario: 
You are developing a sales analysis application that processes a list of sales records. You need to use the Stream API to analyze the sales data and generate reports.

Tasks:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
•	Create a new Java project named SalesAnalysis.
2.	Define the SalesRecord Class:
•	Define a SalesRecord class with attributes like recordId, salesPerson, region, amount, and date.
3.	Create Sample Data:
•	In the SalesAnalysis class, create a list of SalesRecord objects with sample data.
4.	Filter Sales Records:
•	Use the Stream API to filter sales records for a specific region.
•	Print the filtered records.
5.	Map and Transform Data:
•	Use the Stream API to extract the sales amounts from the filtered records.
•	Print the sales amounts.
6.	Calculate Total Sales:
•	Use the Stream API to calculate the total sales amount for the filtered records.
•	Print the total sales amount.
7.	Group Sales by SalesPerson:
•	Use the Stream API to group sales records by salesPerson.
•	Print the grouped sales records.
8.	Generate Sales Report:
•	Use the Stream API to generate a sales report that includes the total sales amount for each salesperson.
