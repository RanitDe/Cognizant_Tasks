## Exercise 1: Implementing a Product Catalog with Set and HashSet

## Objectives:
•	Understand and use the Set interface and HashSet class.
•	Add, remove, and search for elements in a HashSet.

## Business Scenario: 
You are developing a product catalog for an online store. The catalog should store unique product names and provide functionality to add, remove, and search for products.
Tasks:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
•	Create a new Java project named ProductCatalog.
2.	Create a ProductCatalog Class:
•	In the ProductCatalog project, create a class named ProductCatalog.
•	Use a HashSet<String> to store unique product names.
3.	Add Products:
•	Implement a method addProduct(String productName) to add a product to the catalog.
•	Ensure that the product name is unique and not already in the catalog.
4.	Remove Products:
•	Implement a method removeProduct(String productName) to remove a product from the catalog.
5.	Search Products:
•	Implement a method searchProduct(String productName) to check if a product exists in the catalog.
6.	Display Products:
•	Implement a method displayProducts() to display all products in the catalog.
7.	Testing:
•	Create a main class ProductCatalogTest with a main method.
•	Add, remove, and search for products using the ProductCatalog class.
•	Print the catalog contents to verify the functionality.
