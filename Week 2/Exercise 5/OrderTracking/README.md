## Exercise 5: Customer Order Tracking with LinkedList

## Objectives:
•	Understand and use the LinkedList class.
•	Perform operations on a doubly linked list.

## Business Scenario: 
You need to track customer orders for a restaurant. The order list should allow for adding, processing, and displaying orders in a sequence.
Tasks:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
•	Create a new Java project named OrderTracking.
2.	Create an Order Class:
•	In the OrderTracking project, create a class named Order with attributes orderId (int) and orderDetails (String).
3.	Create an OrderTracking Class:
•	Create a class named OrderTracking with a LinkedList<Order> to store customer orders.
4.	Add Orders:
•	Implement a method addOrder(Order order) to add an order to the list.
5.	Process Orders:
•	Implement a method processOrder() to remove and return the first order from the list (FIFO).
6.	Display Orders:
•	Implement a method displayOrders() to display all orders in the list.
7.	Testing:
•	Create a main class OrderTrackingTest with a main method.
•	Add, process, and display orders using the OrderTracking class.
