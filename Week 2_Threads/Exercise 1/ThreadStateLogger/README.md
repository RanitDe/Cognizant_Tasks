## Exercise 1: Understanding Thread States

## Objectives:
•	Learn about different states of a thread.
•	Understand how threads transition between states.

## Business Scenario: 
You are developing a logging system that needs to monitor the states of various threads in a multithreaded application. You need to create a thread and observe its state transitions.

## Tasks:
1.	Create a New Java Class:
•	Create a Java class named ThreadStateLogger.
2.	Implement Thread States Logging:
•	Define a new thread class that overrides the run method to perform a simple task (e.g., printing numbers).
•	In the ThreadStateLogger class, create an instance of this thread.
•	Log the state of the thread at various points: before starting, after starting, during execution, and after completion.
3.	Execute the Program:
•	Run the ThreadStateLogger class and observe the output showing the state transitions of the thread.
