## Exercise 3: Using Sleep, Yield, and Join

## Objectives:
•	Understand the use of sleep, yield, and join methods in thread management.

## Business Scenario: 
You are developing a task scheduler where tasks need to be paused, yielded to other tasks, or waited upon.

## Tasks:
1.	Create a New Java Class:
•	Create a Java class named TaskScheduler.
2.	Define Task Threads:
•	Create a thread class named Task that performs a sequence of operations.
•	Use sleep to pause the task for a few seconds.
•	Use yield to allow other tasks to execute.
•	Use join to wait for a dependent task to complete.
3.	Implement Task Scheduling:
•	In the TaskScheduler class, create and start multiple Task threads.
•	Demonstrate the use of sleep, yield, and join in the task threads.
4.	Execute the Program:
•	Run the TaskScheduler class and observe the task scheduling behavior.
