## Exercise 2: User Registration System with TreeSet

## Objectives:
•	Understand and use the TreeSet class.
•	Store and retrieve elements in a sorted order.

## Business Scenario: 
You are building a user registration system where users' names need to be stored in alphabetical order.
Tasks:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
•	Create a new Java project named UserRegistration.
2.	Create a UserRegistration Class:
•	In the UserRegistration project, create a class named UserRegistration.
•	Use a TreeSet<String> to store users' names in alphabetical order.
3.	Register Users:
•	Implement a method registerUser(String userName) to add a user to the registration system.
4.	Remove Users:
•	Implement a method removeUser(String userName) to remove a user from the registration system.
5.	Display Users:
•	Implement a method displayUsers() to display all registered users in alphabetical order.
6.	Testing:
•	Create a main class UserRegistrationTest with a main method.
•	Register, remove, and display users using the UserRegistration class.
•	Verify that users are displayed in alphabetical order.
