## Exercise 3: Managing Book Collection with LinkedHashSet

## Objectives:
•	Understand and use the LinkedHashSet class.
•	Maintain insertion order of elements.

## Business Scenario: 
You are managing a book collection for a library. The collection should maintain the order in which books were added.
Tasks:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
•	Create a new Java project named BookCollection.
2.	Create a BookCollection Class:
•	In the BookCollection project, create a class named BookCollection.
•	Use a LinkedHashSet<String> to store book titles while preserving insertion order.
3.	Add Books:
•	Implement a method addBook(String bookTitle) to add a book to the collection.
4.	Remove Books:
•	Implement a method removeBook(String bookTitle) to remove a book from the collection.
5.	Display Books:
•	Implement a method displayBooks() to display all books in the collection in the order they were added.
6.	Testing:
•	Create a main class BookCollectionTest with a main method.
•	Add, remove, and display books using the BookCollection class.
•	Verify that books are displayed in the order they were added.
