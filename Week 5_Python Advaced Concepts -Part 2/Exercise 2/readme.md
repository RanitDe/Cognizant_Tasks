## Exercise 2: Error Handling

## Objectives:
â€¢	Handle errors and exceptions in Python.

## Business Scenario: 
You are developing a financial application that processes transactions. The application should handle various errors that may occur during processing, such as invalid input or file not found.

## Tasks:
1.	Error Handling:
o	Create a new Python file named transaction_processing.py.
o	Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors during transaction processing.
o	Implement custom error messages for different types of errors.

2.	Validation:
o	Validate transaction data before processing.
o	Prompt the user to correct any invalid data.

3.	Logging Errors:
o	Write a function to log errors to a file.
o	Ensure all exceptions are logged with a timestamp.

4.	User Feedback:
o	Provide meaningful feedback to the user when errors occur.
o	Ensure the application continues running after handling an error.
