## Exercise 3: Inventory Management System

## Objectives:
•	Use loops and data structures to manage data.
•	Learn to traverse and manipulate lists.

## Business Scenario: 
You are creating an inventory management system for a retail store. The system should keep track of item quantities and alert when an item is out of stock.

## Tasks:
1.	Create a new Python file named inventory_management.py.
2.	Define a list of items with their quantities (e.g., [('item1', 10), ('item2', 0), ('item3', 5)]).
3.	Write a function check_inventory(inventory) that prints a message if any item is out of stock.
4.	Iterate over the list and use the function to check the inventory.
5.	Print the results.
