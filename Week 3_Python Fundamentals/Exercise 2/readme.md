## Exercise 2: Order Processing System

## Objectives:
•	Use control structures like if-else statements.
•	Implement business logic based on conditions.

## Business Scenario: 
You are developing an order processing system for an online store. The system should apply a discount to orders over $100.

## Tasks:
1.	Create a new Python file named order_processing.py.
2.	Define a variable for the order amount.
3.	Write a function apply_discount(order_amount) that applies a 10% discount if the order amount is greater than $100.
4.	Calculate the final price for an example order amount of $150.
5.	Print the final price after applying the discount.
