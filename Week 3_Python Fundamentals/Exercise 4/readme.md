## Objectives:
•	Use dictionaries to store and manipulate key-value pairs.
•	Implement basic data retrieval and update operations.

## Business Scenario: 
You are analyzing customer data for a marketing campaign. The system should store customer names and their purchase amounts, and you need to update and retrieve this data as required.

## Tasks:
1.	Create a new Python file named customer_data.py.
2.	Define a dictionary to store customer names and their purchase amounts (e.g., {'Alice': 120, 'Bob': 75, 'Charlie': 90}).
3.	Write a function update_purchase(customer_data, name, amount) that updates the purchase amount for a given customer.
4.	Use the function to update the purchase amount for 'Bob' to 100.
5.	Print the updated customer data.
