## Exercise 5: Sales Report Generator

## Objectives:
•	Use loops and conditional statements to generate reports.
•	Learn to format and display data.

## Business Scenario: 
You are tasked with generating a sales report for the previous month. The report should list the total sales and highlight any sales over $500.

## Tasks:
1.	Create a new Python file named sales_report.py.
2.	Define a list of sales amounts (e.g., [200, 600, 150, 800, 300]).
3.	Write a function generate_report(sales) that iterates over the sales list and prints each sale amount. Highlight any sale over $500.
4.	Call the function to generate a report for the example sales list.
5.	Print the total sales for the month.
