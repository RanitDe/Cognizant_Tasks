## Exercise 5: Python Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets (Collection Objects)

## Objectives:
•	Understand and use Python collections: lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
•	Perform various operations on these collections.

## Business Scenario: 
You are creating an inventory management system that keeps track of products, their quantities, and prices. You need to use different collections to store and manipulate this data.

## Tasks:
1.	Lists:
o	Create a new Python file named inventory_management.py.
o	Create a list of product names.
o	Write functions to add, remove, and update products in the list.

2.	Dictionaries:
o	Use a dictionary to store product details (name, quantity, price).
o	Write functions to add, update, and delete product details.

3.	Tuples:
o	Use tuples to represent immutable product data.
o	Demonstrate how to use tuples in a product catalog.

4.	Sets:
o	Use sets to track unique product categories.
o	Write functions to add and remove categories from the set.

5.	Combining Collections:
o	Write a function to generate a report of products sorted by price.
o	Write a function to find products that fall within a certain price range using set operations.
