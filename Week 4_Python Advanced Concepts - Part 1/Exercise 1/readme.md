## Exercise 1: Advanced Payroll System with Overtime Calculation

## Objectives:
•	Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
•	Implement classes and methods.
•	Use inheritance to extend functionality.

## Business Scenario: 
You are tasked with enhancing the payroll system to handle overtime pay. Employees should receive 1.5 times their hourly rate for any hours worked beyond 40 in a week.

## Tasks:
1.	Create a new Python file named advanced_payroll_system.py.
2.	Define a class Employee with attributes name, hours_worked, and hourly_rate.
3.	Implement a method calculate_pay() that calculates the total pay, including overtime pay.
4.	Create a subclass Manager that has an additional attribute bonus.
5.	Override the calculate_pay() method in the Manager class to include the bonus in the total pay.
6.	Instantiate objects for both Employee and Manager and calculate their pay.
7.	Print the total pay for both.
