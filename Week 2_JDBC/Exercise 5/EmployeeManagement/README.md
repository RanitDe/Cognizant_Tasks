## Exercise 5: JDBC Application to Access Data from Table

## Objectives:
•	Develop a JDBC application to access and manipulate data from a MySQL table.

## Business Scenario: 
You need to create a Java application that allows users to interact with the employee database, perform CRUD operations, and view employee data.

Tasks:
1.	User Interface:
•	Create a simple console-based user interface that prompts the user to choose an operation (Add, Update, Delete, View).
2.	Add Employee:
•	Prompt the user to enter employee details (name, position, salary).
•	Call the addEmployee() method to add the new employee to the database.
3.	Update Employee:
•	Prompt the user to enter the employee ID and new details.
•	Call the updateEmployee() method to update the employee record.
4.	Delete Employee:
•	Prompt the user to enter the employee ID.
•	Call the deleteEmployee() method to delete the employee record.
5.	View Employees:
•	Call the getEmployees() method to retrieve and display all employee records.
6.	Loop and Exit:
•	Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit the application.
