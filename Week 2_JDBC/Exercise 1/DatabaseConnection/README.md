## Exercise 1: Setting Up MySQL Database Access Using Java

## Objectives:
•	Set up a MySQL database.
•	Connect to the MySQL database using Java.

## Business Scenario: 
You are developing an employee management system that requires storing and retrieving employee data from a MySQL database.

Tasks:
1.	Set Up MySQL Database:
•	Install MySQL server on your system.
•	Create a new database named employee_db.
•	Create a table named employees with columns id (INT, primary key, auto-increment), name (VARCHAR), position (VARCHAR), and salary (DECIMAL).
2.	Create a Java Project:
•	Set up a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
•	Add the MySQL JDBC driver to your project dependencies.
3.	Establish a Connection:
•	Create a new Java class named DatabaseConnection.
•	Write code to establish a connection to the employee_db using JDBC.
•	Ensure the connection is successful by printing a success message.
