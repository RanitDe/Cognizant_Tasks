## Exercise 1: Handling Files with Python

## Objectives:
•	Read from and write to files in Python.
•	Differentiate between binary and text files.

## Business Scenario: 
You are creating a file-based contact management system. The system should store contacts in a file and allow users to read, add, and remove contacts.

## Tasks:
1.	Text Files:
o	Create a new Python file named contact_management.py.
o	Write functions to read from and write to a text file.
o	Add, remove, and display contacts stored in the text file.

2.	Binary Files:
o	Write functions to handle binary files.
o	Save and load contact information in a binary format.

3.	User Interaction:
o	Capture user input to add and remove contacts.
o	Display the list of contacts stored in the file.

4.	Error Handling:
o	Implement error handling for file operations.
o	Ensure the program gracefully handles missing files or corrupted data.
